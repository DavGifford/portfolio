My web portfoilo was created mostly created with HTML and Bootstrap 5. The website is very simple yet works-ish, i coded it while burnt out. I chose to use Bootstrap over CSS because to challange my self. The major challange I faced was using Bootstrap and learning to get it to do what i want it to. I sovled those issues with lots of googling and youtube guides. All images i used, I created beforehand and just edited them some what. The travis be cool image was created for this assignment.
